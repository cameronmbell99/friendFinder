# **friendFinder**

This *Friend Finder* application allows *you* the user to answer our simple 10 question survey and match with our own list of previous customers, which comprise of some of the biggest names in HollyWood. The Simple questions allow for an easy user experience and quick Friend Selection. 

The app's process:
* Entering Inormation
    * The *Friend Finder* Application compares your answers against celebrities
* Algorithm
    * Using our "*rather complex*" matching algorithm we find you the best match out there
* Displaying New Friend
    * the algorithm finds your best match
    * but there seems to be a bug when it comes to displaying it
